# TwentyTwo

A dotnet solution for [Advent of Code 2022 day 22](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/22) part 2.

This exists because I'm too smooth brained to create a general purpose cube folder in Rust.

## Build

Build and test with dotnet. Dotnet SDK 7 should be installed.

```bash
dotnet test
```

```bash
cd twentytwo
dotnet run
```
